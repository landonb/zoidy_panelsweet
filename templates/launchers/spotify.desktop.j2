# 2019-03-05: Use kdocker, so Spotify minizimes to the tray.
# 2020-03-06: Building v5.2, b/c distro 5.0 not working in Mint 19.3 (so ~/.local/bin).
# - Options (`~/.local/bin/kdocker -h`):                         Right-click menu item
#   -q   Disable ballooning title changes (quiet)                !Balloon title changes
#   -i <icon-file>
# - Were on, now off, I think I prefer without:
#   -o   Dock when obscured                                      Iconify when obscured
#   -l   Iconify when focus lost                                 Iconify when focus lost
#   -m   Keep application window showing (don't hide on dock)    !Iconify when minimized
# - Have not tried (among other options):
#   -s   Make the window sticky (appears on all desktops)        Sticky
#          (Currently, if you're on another desktop and click tray icon,
#           desktop will switch back to, e.g., the first desktop.)
#   -t   Remove this application from the taskbar
# - On by default and not controllable from CLI options?:        Lock to desktop
# - If you're curious about BAMF_DESKTOP_FILE_HINT, you'll find it at & in:
