# [lb]: I had issues with letting mate-panel react to dconf changes. It seemed
# to work -- you'd see it sort of update after fiddling with dconf, above --
# and they a final poke-restart sometimes work, e.g.,
#   - name: Kill-to-Restart mate-panel, to reload window-list
#     shell: sleep 5.0 ; killall -s SIGUSR1 mate-panel
# but after running the task a few times, mate-panel would just end up
# dead, and restarting it wouldn't work well, and then you'd have to logoff
# and log back on, and then if you ran the task just once, it'd usually work.
# So now the workflow is to kill mate-panel, do the work, and then restart it.
# BEWARE: If you're running this task on the locally machine, you'll lose your
# mouse connection to MATE until the panel is restarted, e.g., you won't be
# able to access the menu or any launchers; what you can do is alt-tab to any
# already-open terminals you have.
